A Class-Based Python Chess Game Variant (Hunter Falcon Chess)

Locations on the board will is specified using "algebraic notation", with columns labeled a-h and rows labeled 1-8, as shown in this diagram:

Special rules for this variant of chess:

Each of the players in the reserve has one piece of the **Falcon** and the **Hunter**.

Falcon: moves forward like a bishop, and backward like a rook

Hunter: moves forward like a rook and backward like a bishop

The falcon and hunter start the game off the board and out of play (see diagram). Once a player loses their queen, a rook, a bishop, or a knight, they may, on any subsequent move, enter their falcon or hunter into play on any **empty square of their two home ranks**. Doing so constitutes a turn. The player becomes eligible to enter their remaining fairy piece (falcon or hunter) after losing a second piece (queen, rook, bishop, or knight)(could be anytime after losing the first piece, donâ€™t need to be losing after entering the first fairy piece).

My ChessVar class includes the following:
* An **init method** that initializes all data members
* A method called **get_game_state** that just returns 'UNFINISHED', 'WHITE_WON', 'BLACK_WON'. 
* A method called **make_move** that takes two parameters - strings that represent the square moved from and the square moved to.   If the square being moved from does not contain a piece belonging to the player whose turn it is, or if the indicated move is not legal, or if the game has already been won, then it **just returns False**.  Otherwise it makes the indicated move, removes any captured piece, updates the game state if necessary, updates whose turn it is, and returns True.
* A method called **enter_fairy_piece** that takes two parameters - strings that represent the type of the piece (white falcon 'F', white hunter 'H', black falcon 'f', black hunter 'h') and the square it will enter. For example, enter_fairy_piece ('H', 'c1'). If the fairy piece is not allowed to enter this position at this turn for any reason, it **just returns False**.  Otherwise it enters the board at that position, updates whose turn it is, and returns True.

Here's a very simple example of how the class can be used:
```
game = ChessVar()
move_result = game.make_move('c2', 'c4')
game.make_move('g7', 'g5')
state = game.get_game_state()
```
